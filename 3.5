*3.5 (Find future dates) Write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer for
todayâ€™s day of the week (Sunday is 0, Monday is 1, . . ., and Saturday is 6). Also
prompt the user to enter the number of days after today for a future day and display
the future day of the week. Here is a sample run:
Enter today's day: 1
Enter the number of days elapsed since today: 3
Today is Monday and the future day is Thursday

Enter today's day: 0
Enter the number of days elapsed since today: 31
Today is Sunday and the future day is Wednesday
