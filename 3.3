*3.3 (Algebra: solve 2 * 2 linear equations) You can use Cramer’s rule to solve the
following 2 * 2 system of linear equation:
ax + by = e
cx + dy = f
x = (ed - bf) / (ad - bc)
y = (af - ec) / (ad - bc)

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a, b, c, d, e, and f and displays the
result. If ad - bc is 0, report that “The equation has no solution”.

Enter a, b, c, d, e, f: 9.0 4.0 3.0 -5.0 -6.0 -21.0
x is -2.0 and y is 3.0

Enter a, b, c, d, e, f: 1.0 2.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 5.0
The equation has no solution

        if (a*d - b*c != 0) {
        double x = (e*d - b*f) / (a*d - b*c);
        double y = (a*f - e*c) / (a*d - b*c);
