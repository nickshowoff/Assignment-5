**3.4 (Game: learn addition) Write a program that generates two integers under 100
and prompts the user to enter the sum of these two integers. The program then
reports true if the answer is correct, false otherwise. The program is similar to
Listing 3.1.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class java {
   public static void  main(String[] args){
        int number1 = (int)(System.currentTimeMillis() % 100);       
        int number2 = (int)(System.currentTimeMillis() / 7 % 100);

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
	System.out.println("What is " + number1 + " + " + number2  + "? ");
        
        int answer = input.nextInt();
        System.out.println("number1 + " + " + number2 + " + " = " + answer + " is " + (number1 + number2 == answer));
        
       
  }
}
